## 🚀 Welcome to Use AWS EC2 as your Personal Computer Workshop

In this workshop you would experience creating a virtual machine from scratch. Now, we would start by diving down the AWS console and then we would go on to create a Linux VM on EC2 with help of asymmetric encryption and then connect it with the loved VSCode. 

By the end, you would be able to run your workloads directly on EC2 via VSCode and use it for development purposes

### ⚠️ Cleaning Up
This workshop uses AWS services that are mostly covered by the Free Tier allowance - ONLY if your account is less than 12 months old. For accounts passed the free tier eligibility, it may incur some costs. To minimize the cost, **make sure you delete resources used in this workshop when you are finished.**
