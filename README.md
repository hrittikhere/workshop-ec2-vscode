## üöÄ Welcome to Use AWS EC2 as your Personal Computer Workshop

In this workshop you would experience creating a virtual machine from scratch. Now, we would start by diving down the AWS console and then we would go on to create a Linux VM on EC2 with help of asymmetric encryption and then connect it with the loved VSCode. 

By the end, you would be able to run your workloads directly on EC2 via VSCode and use it for development purposes

### üìñ About This Workshop


This is L100-200 workshop and specifically structured for developers from any levels. Knowledge on what SSH, Docker is should be helpful!

### üí° Context 

Two years ago, I began my journey in the technology industry by learning development and DevOps. However, I encountered a problem during this process. The internet bandwidth in India was not sufficient, which resulted in extremely slow download speeds for Docker images. This made it take a very long time for the images to be pulled and made it difficult for me to efficiently learn and work with the technology.

One of the easiest solutions I found to overcome the issue of slow internet speeds was to utilize a cloud virtual machine (VM) through student programs. By doing so, I was able to use the VM as my personal computer. This approach had several benefits, such as improved performance and faster internet speeds. By running a VM in the cloud, I was able to access the resources of a powerful computer and avoid the limitations of my local machine. 

Additionally, the cloud-based VM allowed me to access my development environment from anywhere, which provided greater flexibility and convenience. 

Currently, there are more container-based solutions available in the market that can perform better in certain scenarios. However, virtual machines (VMs) continue to be a useful option for some because of their ability to run applications which require virtualization like VirtualBox like MiniKube and also satisfy memory and CPU, GPU requirements which containers fail to address. 

### ü§ö Key Takeways

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cleaning Up
This workshop uses AWS services that are mostly covered by the Free Tier allowance - ONLY if your account is less than 12 months old. For accounts passed the free tier eligibility, it may incur some costs. To minimize the cost, **make sure you delete resources used in this workshop when you are finished.**
