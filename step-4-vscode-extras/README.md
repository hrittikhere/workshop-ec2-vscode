Once you have successfully set up the remote connection, you can do many things with it. The foour most fun things that users prefer range from testing, building and running applications!


## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Building Application

The [/app](/app) directory has an application which we want to built and test in our remote enviroment to understand further steps! 

- Install Docker with the following script:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash
```

In order to build and run the application in a remote environment, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/ or with help of an script 

- Clone this Repo

Once you have Docker installed, you will need to clone the repository containing the application. You can do this by running the command `git clone https://github.com/hrittikhere/workshop-ec2-vscode` in the terminal.

```bash
hrittik@hrittik:~$ git clone https://github.com/hrittikhere/workshop-ec2-vscode

- Move to /app directory

After cloning the repository, navigate to the /app directory using the command `cd workshop-ec2-vscode/workshop-ec2-vscode/step-4-vscode-extras/app`

```bash
hrittik@hrittik:~$ cd workshop-ec2-vscode/step-4-vscode-extras/app/

hrittik@hrittik:~/workshop-ec2-vscode/step-4-vscode-extras/app$ ls
Dockerfile  README.md  deploy
```

- Docker build
 
 Once you have verified that the Dockerfile is correct, you can build the application by running the command `docker build -t [image-name] .` in the terminal.
 
 
 ```bash
 
hrittik@hrittik:~/workshop-ec2-vscode/step-4-vscode-extras/app$ docker build -t hrittik:test .

- Run Application

Finally, you can run the application by running the command `docker run -p [host-port]:[container-port] [image-name]` in the terminal. This will start the application and make it accessible on the specified host port.

```bash

hrittik@hrittik:~/workshop-ec2-vscode/step-4-vscode-extras/app$ docker run -p 5000:5000 hrittik:test

## ‚è© Port Forwarding

You can also use the remote connection to forward a local port to a remote port, allowing you to access a service running on the remote host from your local machine. This can be useful for testing or debugging your application, as well as for accessing network resources that are not publicly accessible for temporary purpose.

Use Ports section to map a new port! Now visit your browswer to access the port on your local host:

## üìÇ File System Access

With the remote connection, you can access the file system of the remote host as if you were working directly on the machine. You can create, edit and delete files and directories, and use version control systems to manage your codebase.

Try uploading files to your remote server without any additional requirements!
